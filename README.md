# ReleaseTest

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository is exclusively used for testing the [CAMARA release automation](https://github.com/camaraproject/tooling/tree/release-automation/release_automation) workflow ([tooling#72](https://github.com/camaraproject/tooling/issues/72)). It is not an actual API repository. Issues, releases, and branches may be created and deleted at any time without notice.

## Scope

Test repository for end-to-end validation of the automated release workflow. Contains a minimal API stub to exercise the full release lifecycle:

* Sync Release Issue from `release-plan.yaml`
* Create snapshot and release-review branch
* Generate CHANGELOG and README updates
* Publish release with branch protection enforced
* Post-release sync PR back to main
